TaDiRAH - Taxonomy of Digital Research Activities in the Humanities
===================================================================

Introduction
------------

The following taxonomy of DH research activities and objects has been developed for use by community-driven sites and projects that aim to structure information relevant to digital humanities and make it more easily discoverable. The taxonomy is expected to be particularly useful to endeavors aiming to collect information on digital humanities tools, methods, projects, or readings.

TaDiRAH is usually pronounced "ta-DEE-ra" and is not an animal. However, DiRT and DARIAH are both partial anagrams of it.
